# NewsBuddy
Our News Buddy program is able to take in inputs from people and either determine the closest entities or queries relating to it. If the user wants entities, the program will return a list of entities.  If the user wants documents, the computer will return a list of documents and then ask the user if they want a summary of one of them.  If user prompts yes, the program will summarize the desired document with the desired length.  The algorithm is sourced from smmry.com. 

## Usage
Open command line or git bash and run python app.py.  Ensure the ngrok server is up and that Alexa points to the right https link.  After, Alexa will have questions prompting you for actions to preform.  Follow her to get desired output.
