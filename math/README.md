# Math
Our math program is able to take in math problems from people and through Wolfram Alpha's API, obtain an answer. The answer is then processed through formatting to ensure that Alexa can read it correctly.  Despite the fact that this program is simple because it uses Wolfram Alpha directly, we thought it would be good if Wolfram Alpha's technology was applied to a cognitive assitant to ensure easy access for users.  This allows many users to multi-task or calculate on the fly to ensure maximum efficiency.  

## Usage
Open command line or git bash and run python app.py.  Ensure the ngrok server is up and that Alexa points to the right https link.  After, Alexa will have questions prompting you for actions to preform.  Follow her to get desired output.
